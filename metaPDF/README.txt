metaPDF
--------


PREREQUISITES

- KDE / Dolphin
- kdialog / Zenity
- pdftk
- ghostscript
- bash



HOWTO

In order to use this script do the following:

1) run the install.sh script to copy the files to the necessary locations

2) wait a short while until KDE/Dolphin picks up the new service menu entry

3) select one or more PDFs in dolphin, right-click and chose
   "Add/alter meta data in PDFs" from the actions menus

4) it will cycle through all the PDFs and ask for the new meta data for each of the PDFs

5) it will then save the PDF with a new timestamp in the name and leave the original untouched
